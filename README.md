# Hello and Good Day People. 
# This is my Final Year Project: Football Video Skills Classification Using Deep Learning
# How to use the code? 
# You need to collect the data manually, that specifically requires you to perform 5 different movement skills in Football.
# The skills are : 'Stepover', 'Body Feint', 'Chop', 'Quick Turn' and 'Roulette'
# Note that the video recorded should be up from your waist to your legs. Dont forget you need a ball too !
